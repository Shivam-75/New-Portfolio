      "The Blood Bank Management System is a full-stack MERN application designed to streamline blood donation, stock monitoring, and request handling. It features secure authentication using JWT (access + refresh tokens), Bcrypt password encryption, and a fully responsive React UI. The admin dashboard enables donor/recipient management, real-time blood group stock updates, and request approval workflows. A unique AI-powered Medicine Assistant is included to help users with medicine and health suggestions. This project strengthened my skills in backend security, database design, real-time updates, and AI feature integration.",

      "The Pathology Management System is a full-stack MERN-based digital solution for diagnostic labs and clinics. It includes secure JWT authentication with role-based access for admins, doctors, and patients. Admins can manage tests, create bills, track patients, generate date-wise analytics, and export invoices as PDFs. Patients can browse tests, book appointments, view pricing, and track their medical reports online. The project improved my skills in authentication, PDF generation, database modeling, and real-world healthcare workflow implementation.",
